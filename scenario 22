write a trigger to prevent a user from deleting an account record if it has related opportunity record.

Sobject -- account
Data --- trigger.oldMap
DML event -- before delete


apex class:

public class PreventDeleteAcc 
{
    public static void notToDelete(map<Id,Account> oldAccount)
    {
        List<id> accList = new List<id>(oldAccount.keyset());
        List<Opportunity> relateOpp = [Select id from Opportunity where AccountId IN :accList];
        if(!relateOpp.isEmpty())
        {
            for(id accId :accList)
            {
                Account acc = oldAccount.get(accId);
                acc.addError('if related opportunity is present then you are not allowed to delete account');
            }
        }
    }
}


apex trigger:

trigger PreDel on Account (before delete) 
{
	PreventDeleteAcc.notToDelete(trigger.oldMap);
}
